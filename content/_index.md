I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Calgary. I enjoy building things and collaborating with others in a shared setting and being a part of a community that shares this passion for coming up with innovative solutions for problems.

As an aspiring Software Engineer and DevOps enthusiast, I love assembling things, both software and hardware, from scratch and automating everything. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends.

I have developed a few projects with the goal of making my day-to-day life just a little bit _easier_. You can check them out [here](/projects).

Thanks for stopping by my little corner on the Internet!
