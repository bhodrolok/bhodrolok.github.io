Hey there! I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Calgary. I enjoy problem-solving, building things and collaborating with others in a shared setting and being a part of a community that shares this passion for coming up with innovative solutions for problems.

As an aspiring Software Engineer and DevOps enthusiast, I love assembling things (both software and hardware!) from the ground up and automating things to make the workflow more efficient. Infact, I have developed multiple personal projects for making my day-to-day life just a little bit easier.

Whether tinkering with backend systems or exploring bleeding edge front-end designs, I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

Other than that, you'll find me exploring the wonderful City of Calgary, going hiking in the Rockies and enjoying the great outdoors. I'm also a huge fan of football (BVB since 2011) and cricket (KKR since 2008)!

Thanks for stopping by my little corner on the Internet!
