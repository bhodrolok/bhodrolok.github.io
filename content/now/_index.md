Some of the things that I am occupied with **now** are:

- Working on [JobAppTrackr](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/JobAppTrackr), [rupantar](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/rupantar), and this [website](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/Bhodrolok.github.io).
- Learning C# and Golang. 
- Gitting gud at [bash](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html).
- Finding ways to improve my previous projects with my current knowledge.
- Trying to self-host some apps & services on my servers <span class='natural-type'>without breaking them.</span>
- Practicing mindfulness and gratitude.
- Catching up on my reading list and movies backlog.
