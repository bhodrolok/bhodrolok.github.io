Some of the things that I am occupied with now are:

- Working on JobAppTrackr, rupantar and this website
- Learning C# and Golang
- Finding ways to improve my previous projects with my current knowledge 
- Trying to self-host some apps & services on my home server without breaking it
- Practicing mindfulness and gratitude
- Going through my reading backlog
