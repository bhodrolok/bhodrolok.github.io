> <span class='natural-type'> As of December 25, 2023 </span>

Some of the things that I am occupied with **now** are:

- Working on [JobAppTrackr](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/JobAppTrackr), [rupantar](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/rupantar) and this [website](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/Bhodrolok.github.io).
- Learning C# and Golang.
- Finding ways to improve my previous projects with my current knowledge 
- Trying to self-host some apps & services on my home server <span class='natural-type'>without breaking it.</span>
- Practicing mindfulness and gratitude.
- Catching up on my reading list and backlog of movies.
