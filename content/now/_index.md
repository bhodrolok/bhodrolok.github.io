> <span class='natural-type'> As of March 14, 2024 </span>

Some of the things that I am occupied with **now** are:

- Working on [JobAppTrackr](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/JobAppTrackr), [rupantar](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/rupantar), and this [website](https://github.com/Bhodrolok/Bhodrolok.github.io). 
    - A few others on top of these but those are still mostly in the drawing board/Proof-of-Concept stage!
- Learning C# and Golang while also getting better with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python (along with their ever-evolving ecosystems!).  
- Gitting gud at [bash](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html) and [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) scripting. 
   - TUIs >>> GUIs
- Trying to self-host some apps & services on my servers <span class='natural-type'>without breaking them.</span>
   - A whole lotta [Docker](https://xkcd.com/1988/)-ing. Works on LAN btw. 
- Playing around with [OCI](https://www.oracle.com/in/cloud/compute/virtual-machines/). 
   - I find their ['Always Free'](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm) tier offering much more generous than the other Cloud Service Providers.   
- Practicing mindfulness and gratitude.
- Catching up on my reading list and movies backlog. Some podcasts here and there as well!
   - Will probably work on something that allows me to post them here on this website with an automated status update workflow ðŸš§
