Bit of a background, I graduated from the University of Calgary 🦖🏒 in 2023 where I majored in Computer Science. I enjoy building things and collaborating with others in a shared setting and being a part of a community that shares this passion for coming up with innovative solutions to problems. 

As an aspiring Software Engineer and DevOps enthusiast, I love assembling things, both software and hardware, from scratch. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends.

Other than all that, I am pretty big into sports, especially football(or soccer as it's called here in NA) and cricket. For both these sports, I am a die hard fan of Borussia Dortmund and Kolkata Knight Riders and have been since 2011 (maybe a bit earlier for the latter 🏏). I feel like it definitely helps motivate me in pursuing an active lifestyle.

I also consider myself to be somewhat of a photographer (albeit an 'opportunistic' and low-budget one :P). Putting some of my _proud_ captures on display here in this website is definitely something that I am working on.
