# Bhodrolok.github.io

üîç Source code for my personal website üíª.

---

Created using the Rust-based [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [Serene](https://github.com/isunjn/serene) theme applied.

**Building**: `zola --config /your/custom/config.toml build`

**Serving**: `zola --config /your/custom/config.toml serve --port $YOUR_PORT`

Detailed documentation for creating a site like this of your own can be found [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) and [here](https://github.com/isunjn/serene/blob/latest/USAGE.md).

Zola is part of the `Jamstack` (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) _ecosystem_, which is basically a modern, cross-platform, web development *approach* that emphasizes _pre-building_ websites and serving them as static files blazingly fast. It's fun.

You can read more about Jamstack [here](https://jamstack.org/) along with a list of other Static Site Generators [here](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
