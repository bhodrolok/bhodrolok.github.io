üîç Source code for my personal website üíª.

---

Built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene).

**Building**: `zola --config /path/to/configfile.toml build`

**Serving**: `zola --config /path/to/configfile.toml serve --port 57571 --base-url 127.0.0.1`

Detailed documentation for building a similar site of your own can be found [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) and [here](https://github.com/isunjn/serene/wiki/English-Docs).

Zola is part of the `Jamstack` (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) _ecosystem_, which is basically a modern, cross-platform, web development *approach* that emphasizes _pre-building_ websites and serving them as static files blazingly fast. It's pretty neat!

You can read more about Jamstack [here](https://jamstack.org/) along with a list of other Static Site Generators [here](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
