Detailed documentation for building a similar site of your own can be found [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) and [here](https://github.com/isunjn/serene/wiki/English-Docs).

Zola is part of the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) _ecosystem_, which is basically a modern web development *approach* that emphasizes _pre-building_ websites and serving them as static files blazingly fast. It's pretty neat.
